# Central Command Officer
**Role type**: <font color= "#D4AF37">CentCom</font>. **Access**: <font color="green">Everything</font>. **Difficulty**: <font color="Red">Extreme</font>.



Note: The central command officer is not a roundstart role and can currently only be accessed through admin events. The highest roundstart role one can have is [Captain](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Command_roles\Captain.md).


## Who you are

The CCO is the representative of centcom, and as such is higher in the chain of command than even the [captain](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Command_roles\Captain.md). Compared to him, everyone on the station is disposable. Unless you are given a different goal by your [overseers](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Protagonist_roles\Special\Admin.md), your general role will be to guide the [captain](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Command_roles\Captain.md), perform inspections, report situations to centcom, and get the hell out as fast as you can when [people start burning alive](\3_HowToPlay\Guides\General_guides\Battle-royale.md). You should not, under any circumstance, try and apprehend threats to the station yourself or put yourself in harms way. Your revolver, while strong, is meant as a self defense tool, and no matter what armor you have, it wont protect you against a sufficiently willing and skilled [traitor](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Antagonist_roles\Traitor.md).



## How to do your job

While combat is out of the question, your job thankfully does not call for it. Instead you can generally ignore any thefts of the captains gear,or assassinations of officers and instead report them to your [supervisors](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Protagonist_roles\Special\Admin.md). To keep yourself safe, be near two or more people at any time and stay in public areas. NEVER wander into areas such as maint or escape alone. Should the station become inoperable, infested by some [biological](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Antagonist_roles\Blob.md) [threat](\4_Univers\Mobs\Xenomorph.md), stocked full of [blood god worshipping loonies](Blood-cult.md), or otherwise becomes a danger to NT operations in the area, it is your job to report it so that the mess can be [cleaned up](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Protagonist_roles\Centcom_roles\Death-Squad.md) or [fixed](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Protagonist_roles\Centcom_roles\Emergency-Response-Team.md) by a specialized task force.



## Your gear

The CCO doesn't have much gear of his own, surprisingly. You have a bottle of Badmin Brew, A Mateba revolver which acts identically to the .357 revolvers, and a set of clothing that is just re-textured [captains](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Command_roles\Captain.md) gear. Depending on the whims of your [supervisors](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Protagonist_roles\Special\Admin.md), you may, rarely, receive additional gear or help from other centcom personnel.
