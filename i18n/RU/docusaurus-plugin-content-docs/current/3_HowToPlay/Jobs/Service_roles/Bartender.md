## Overview 

So you're the Bartender, eh? Selling drinks to security officers and traitors? You'd better keep your beanbags handy." -Chap McCip, self-proclaimed Nanotransen 'Head Demolitions Expert' and 3 time 'War Opportunist'.

The Bartender's job is to make sure those who want a drink get one. Serve your patrons, try to deal with the Detective's 'rogue officer of the law' schtick, listen to their gossip, and feed them useless advice. This job is better suited for those who would like a role play heavy experience from their game. Spark conversation, ask the crew how their day has been. Make up some specials or discounts to get people to come over. Make it fun.


### Tending to your Bar 


Because of the inhibiting nature of the sauce you serve, you get a shotgun that fires stunning beanbag shells and a type 1 armor vest. You are going to need them. The difficulty of [making drinks](Drinks-guide.md) is minimal, but bar fights can be deadly. You will see some of the worst displays of violence on the station. It might not be a bad idea to get friendly with the local [security officers](Security.md) early into your shift for the inevitable scuffles that will happen. Especially the [Detective](Detective.md). They tend to spend more time in the bar than in their office, anyways.

When the bar's empty, it might be tempting to load up your bar counter with drinks to keep the boredom away, but half the fun of bartending is mixing the drinks people ask for while talking to them. Your down time is better spent trying to get people to come to the bar in the first place. Light up the comms with invitations. Get the [chef](Cook.md) to deliver their food to the bar. Declare free drinks on the house; Even though its all free already, it gets butts in seats like you wouldn't believe.


### How to Mix? 

Well, frankly, you just add liquids into a glass and they mix themselves. Before you can mix you need to get familiar with your elements, currently the only appliance that is there for bar tending is the Booze-o-matic. Some recipes all the bartenders should know: 

1 part vodka, 2 parts tomato juice, 1 part lime juice - Bloody Mary

2 parts gin, 1 part vermouth - Classic Martini

3 parts Rum and Coke, 1 part lime juice - Cuba Libre

2 parts gin, 1 part tonic water - Gin and Tonic

2 parts whiskey, 1 part vermouth - Manhattan

2 parts vodka, 1 part orange juice - Screwdriver

1 part Whiskey Cola, 1 part beer - Syndicate Bomb

A full guide on all the drinks can be (will be) found [here](Guide-to-Food-and-Drink.md). Take in account that Vodka is called [https://wiki.baystation12.net/Tunguska_Triple_Distilled Tunguska Triple Distilled] and Whiskey is Old Git's Special Reserve. With that in mind, go out and help some people drink their sorrows away.

### The bottle bearing bludgeoner ([traitor ](traitor.md) Bartender)

A [traitorous](traitor.md) bartender doesn't have a lot going for them. They are a very visible job with little excuse to be anywhere but at the bar. You do start with your shotgun and beanbag shells which is something, but it's a loud weapon with no lethality and the limit of two shots at a time makes it a supplemental weapon at best. Whatever your objectives are, if they require you to leave the bar, you best be gone and done with it as quickly as possible, as your absence will be very telling to any [investigators](detective.md).
