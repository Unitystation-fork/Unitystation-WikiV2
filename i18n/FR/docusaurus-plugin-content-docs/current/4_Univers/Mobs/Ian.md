# Ian
Ian is a [meme](Meme.md) character made by the community to mock the [security](\3_HowToPlay\jobs\Security_roles\Security-Officer.md) personal of the station.

Ian is the dog of the [Head of Personnel](\3_HowToPlay\jobs\Command_role\Head-of-Personnel.md), and is the most important crew member, way more important than the [Captain](\3_HowToPlay\jobs\Command_role\Captain.md) or [HoP](\3_HowToPlay\jobs\Command_role\Head-of-Personnel.md). It is the number one priority for all crew members to ensure that Ian is safe on the [emergency shuttle](emergency-shuttle.md) whenever it departs. Killing Ian is the biggest crime in existence, and anyone guilty for his death will be executed via firing line, no matter the objection of the killer or any other crew member.
