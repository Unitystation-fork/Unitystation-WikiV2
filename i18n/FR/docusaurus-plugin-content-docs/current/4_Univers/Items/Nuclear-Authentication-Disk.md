# Nuclear Authentication Disk
### GET DAT FUKKEN DISK


This disk contains the the encrypted data needed to to activate the station's onboard nuke as well as the the nuke-on-wheels that the [Nuclear Operatives](Nuclear-Emergency.md) get.

If you are the [Captain](Captain.md) or a member of [Security](Security.md), for the love of all that is good on the station, protect this disk with your life. Do not let it fall into the wrong hands, [which](Chief-Engineer.md) [is](Janitor.md) [basically](Assistant.md) [anybody](Mime.md) [else](Clown.md).


### WHERE THE FUK IS IT?

Hello [Nukie](Nuclear-Emergency.md). You want the disk. How do you find who's hiding it? With that little device you got there called the pinpointer. It points in the general direct of the disk no matter how far away it is. All you have to do is follow the arrow and shoot people who try to stop you. So easy, a [Clown](Clown.md) could do it.

Note that if you manage to acquire the disk, you are not the only ones who can track it. The [Captain](Captain.md) and the [HoS](Head-of-Security.md) have their own pinpointers, and some stations will have a few extra lying around. This means that you can be traced just the same as the Captain, though typically you won't have as hard a time keeping the disk. 

Also, all [Death Squad Troopers](Death-Squad.md) come equipped with a pinpointer. If you, the nukies, have overstayed your welcome, or you are station personnel who have royally screwed up, Centcom may send a squad to get the disk, either to save the station or to blow it up themselves. If this happens, you are already dead. You just don't know it.
