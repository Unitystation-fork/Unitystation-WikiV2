# Asteroids
Asteroids are randomly located chunks of rock scattered floating around the station. There are 9 asteroids at round start. Each asteroid has a set layout, but randomly generated ore and somewhat randomly generated threats; mostly lots of space carp, but occasionally [Xenomorphs.](\4_Univers\Mobs\Xenomorph.md) 

These rocks are where [miners](\3_HowToPlay\jobs\Cargo_roles\Shaft-Miner.md) go to die.

### Xenoartifacts

Some Asteroids contain mysterious artifacts which possess unusual properties that can be either helpful or dangerous. The properties and appearance of the artifacts are randomized at round start. Artifacts can most easily tracked down by acquiring an Artifacts Detector, which are available at round start to scientists and the Curator, or can be purchased in the Mining Equipment Vendor. When used in hand, the detector will point out the relative coordinates of the nearest 3 artifacts.

### Space Ruins

Along with Asteroids, some space ruins spawn as well. Space ruins are chunks of old space stations, marooned ships, or other debris. As such, while they won't typically contain ores to mine, they often do have interesting things to find in them, making them worth investigating if you come across them.
