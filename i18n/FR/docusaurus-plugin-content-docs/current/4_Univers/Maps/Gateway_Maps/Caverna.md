# Caverna
Caverna is one of the (currently 4) possible destinations of the teleporter. It is a square airless tangle of dark caverns filled with [Xenomorphs](Xenomorph.md) and [[Husk (mob)|other]] [threats](Blood-drunk-miner.md). Venture within only if you are well armed.


Reasons to go exploring include huge amounts of ore (bring a pick and ore satchel) and some interesting loot, as well as the opportunity to kill lots of Xenos. Be warned however, the Xenomorphs are very numerous and blend in very well. There is also a full nest with a [Queen](Xenomorph-queen.md) lurking in the southwest corner. [[So close to impossible that it might as well not even exist|Maybe you can take her out?]] Alternatively, you can, [if you are quick enough](So-close-to-impossible-that-it-might-as-well-not-even-exist.md), run through and just grab the loot.
