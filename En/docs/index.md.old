UnityStation is a free to play game made as a clone to the [Space Station 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URJ_qSXruW0) game, but built on Unity, instead of using the outdated [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/).  

Space Station 13, the greatest spessmen simulator ever created. If you have ever played SS13 before you can agree on one thing, [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/), it sucks! This is where UnityStation comes in. Started in Nov 2016 we have endeavored to ensure SS13 has a long and prosperous future outside of [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/) by cloning the [/TG/](https://tgstation13.org/) source to Unity.

> A lot of work has been completed since its humble beginnings in 2016 and we have just released our first public alpha release on our version of the [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/) hub called the Station Hub. The project has a growing and dedicated community of contributors who are eager to see this thing become a reality. Best of all it is all open source and available on GitHub.

In this game, you pick from a variety of [roles](Roles.md) on different [maps](Maps.md) to keep the station running:

[![Command](Command.png)](Roles/Command.md) [![Security](Security.png)](Roles/Security.md) [![Engineering](Engineering.png)](Roles/Engineering.md) [![Medical](Medical.png)](Roles/Medical.md) [![Research](Research.png)](Roles/Research.md) [![Supply](Supply.png)](Roles/Supply.md)

[![Service](Service.png)](Roles/Service.md) [![Civilian](Civilian.png)](Roles/Civilian.md) [![Artificials](Artificials.png)](Roles/Artificials.md) [![Antagonists](Antagonists.png)](Roles/Antag.md) [![Special](Special.png)](Roles/Special.md) [![Admin](Admin.png)](Roles/Admin.md)

Or you can try attacking it and maybe nuking it to [ashes](antags/Nuclear-Emergency.md):

Traitor, Changeling, Wizard, Cultist, NukeOps, Blob, Alien, Spider

You can also become various difference races although some may be disabled on certain servers and some to be added:

[![Human](Human.png)](Races/Human),[![Saurian](Saurian.png)](Races/Saurian),[![Plasmamen](Plasmamen.png)](Races/Plasmamen),[![Goople](Goople.png)](Races/Goople),[![Lepidops](Lepidops.png)](Races/Lepidops),[![Lithoid](Lithoid.png)](Races/Lithoid)

[![Nanos](Nano.png)](Races/NaniteFolk),[![Slug](Slug.png)](Races/Slug),[![Wooloo](Sheeple.png)](Races/Sheeple),[![Polygeri](Polygeri.png)](Races/Polygeri),[![Podpeople](Pod.png)](Races/Pod),[![Ave](Ave.png)](Races/Ave)


The game itself is a chaos machine, some times rounds can take 2 minutes. Usually if the wizard suicides into security. Otherwise it can be a 30 minute long [Royale](Battle-royale.md) and others it can be a multiple hour long phoenix wright court simulator or even cult wasteland as the chaplain holds the line against the onslaught. It depends partly on what the server it is and what [random](antags.md) thing happens.
