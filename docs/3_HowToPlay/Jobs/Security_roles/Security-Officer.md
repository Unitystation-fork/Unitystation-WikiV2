# Security Officer
Role type:  <font color= "#711e25">Security</font>. Access levels: <font color="#711e25">Security & cells</font>, Maintenance, Difficulty: <font color="Red">hard</font>.

Security are the Police force of the station, and often the second line of defense against the crew members turning the station into a battle royale (the first line being [Janitors](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Service_roles\Janitor.md)). Often times, you have a simple job: Jail criminals, and make sure [no](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Service_roles\Assistant.md) [one](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Entertainment_Roles\Clown.md) breaks into areas they shouldn't be in.

You are a guardian between the ideals of justice and the wild psychotics that your company has chosen to advance its interests in space. Just because everyone else is insane, however, does not mean you are permitted to go hog-wild and beat them all unconscious to strap them to beds. Professionals have standards.

**DO NOT play Security if you're new to the game, it's a very easy way to find yourself surrounded by people wanting you dead for abusing your powers. It's also a very easy way to get  job banned for not properly applying [Space Law](\3_HowToPlay\Guides\Security_guides\Space-Law.md)**

## SECurity, not SHITcurity

For some unknown reason, NanoTrasen has chosen to fill this top-notch research station with simple minded baboons who enjoy carnage. As a result, Security is mostly a necessity to keep crew members from destroying it. For the most part, this isn't too hard; you have a tazer, a stun baton (press Z while selected to activate stun mode, many have made that mistake before), and some handcuffs. 90% of the time, this is all you need, since someone with a crowbar on the other side of the room can't really do much when you can very easily taze them and then stun with your baton, then cuff them and take them to the cells.

However, sometimes this isn't enough. Maybe [Xenomorphs](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Antagonist_roles\Xenomorph.md) have invaded the station. They can't be stunned or cuffed, so your normal strategy won't really work. Not to worry, if the situation is getting out of hand, the [Warden](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Security_roles\Warden.md) will hopefully allow you a lethal weapon from the armory. Just make sure the [Assistants](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Service_roles\Assistant.md) don't get their greasy, greytider hands on them, and you'll be fine; be _very_ careful of people standing next to you when you are detaining them with weapons. Overall, just obey the orders of the [HoS](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Security_roles\Security-Officer.md), keep assistants out of restricted areas, and arrest the shit out of [any](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Antagonist_roles\Traitor.md) [unwanted](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Antagonist_roles\Nuclear-Operative.md) [crew](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Antagonist_roles\Cargonia.md), and hopefully you're able to [keep the station from turning into pure, unfiltered chaos.](So-close-to-impossible-that-it-might-as-well-not-even-exist.md)

## Know Your Place

The station is ultimately _not_ a military operation, but, as a member of Security, you follow the chain of command closer than any other crewmember:

* You take your orders from the [HoS](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Security_roles\Security-Officer.md).
* You do _not_ have to obey orders from the [Warden](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Security_roles\Warden.md) _unless_ they are acting-HoS.
* You also take orders from the [Captain](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Command_roles\Captain.md), and their orders superceed the HoS and anyone else except [Central Command](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Protagonist_roles\Centcom_roles\Central-Command-Officer.md).
* You do _not_ have to take orders from the [HoP](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Command_roles\Head-of-Personnel.md) _unless_ they are acting-Captain.
* You are expected to act according to [Space Law](\3_HowToPlay\Guides\Security_guides\Space-Law.md) during all of this. However, you must also develop a sense of when to apply Space Law and when to ignore it. If you arrest crewmembers for every little infraction, your career as a Security Officer will be a short lived one.
* You must also act according to Standard Operating Procedure. This defines when you are allowed to have weapons out or not, and when you are allowed to apply lethal force.

## Tips of the Trade

* Stun Batons have infinite charges. Tasers do not. Make sure you get your taser charged from time to time in the brig.
* If you are suspicious of any crewmembers, _keep your distance._ As an upholder of Space Law, you generally have to get probable cause before taking the initiative in a fight. This means that most of your fights will have you on your back foot. Your security armor let's you tank enough damage to probably be able to survive lethal attacks, but it does nothing to stop surprise banana slips, stun baton hits, weapon disarms, and other nasty tricks. If you sense a threat, keep at least 2 tiles between you  and your target until you are ready to make a move.
* Handcuff people by applying handcuffs to them. A handcuffed person _cannot move if they are grabbed by someone else._
* Strip people of their equipment by stunbatoning them and shift-clicking while adjacent to them. Do not put them in a prisoner's jumpsuit unless their stay in the brig is 10 minutes or longer.
* WATCH OUT FOR FLOOR LUBE. It's a very popular tactic to lube the tiles directly outside the security Department doors. Many Security personnel have experienced an early demise for slipping straight out the doors, being dragged away and murdered.

# Security Officer

## Overview

As a security officer it is your direct responsibility to oversee the safety of the station. If the station is going haywire then it is because you failed to do your job. In other words being a security officer is fairly stressful, but please don't let that stress overwhelm you. Do make sure to follow the [Space Law](\3_HowToPlay\Guides\Security_guides\Space-Law.md) in all your doings. Here are a few play styles, pick one you see fitting to you, but don't be afraid to switch around:

## [Obey & Survive]([https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Los_Santos_Police_Department_(HD_Universe) )

Or commonly referred to as "shitcurity", are the kind of officers that believe it's still 1947 and that we're in the USSR, so they can abuse and mess with anyone below them on the food chain. Here's some advice:

1) Don't be like this.

2) Beware of people trying to disarm you.

3) [Clowns](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Entertainment_Roles\Clown.md) and [cargo](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Cargo_roles\Cargo-Technician.md) are your nemesis.

4) Don't expect people to respect you.

5) The feeling of pride you get is temporary.

## [To Protect and to Serve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department )

These kind of officers just go around the station and make sure everything is in order, not intervening unless needed, these types of officers are neutrally perceived by the public so don't expect praise or hate, well except general hate towards security because of the officers mentioned above. Some tips:

1) You should request [AA](\3_HowToPlay\Guides\General_guides\Access.md) from [Head of Personnel](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Command_roles\Head-of-Personnel.md) to make sure to sweep the whole station, to uncover any hidden plots unraveling in the research sector or else.

2) If people tell you to go, don't overstay your welcome.

3) If you have [AA](\3_HowToPlay\Guides\General_guides\Access.md), make sure the kitchen and engineering are doing fine.

4) If you find any xenomorphs then immediately request backup and wait for them, do not engage alone, unless someone is in direct danger.

## [Faithful to Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department)

This type is better suited for those who prefer [role play](\3_HowToPlay\RP\RP-words-and-abbreviations.md) over [combat](Combat.md), these guys hang around bars, talk to citizens, help around the station and otherwise liked. These are the tips that might come in handy for you:

1) Wear a blue uniform with a tie, to stand out and so people can tell you apart from the types above.

2) If people get nervous around you, or otherwise don't like you, prove yourself to them by actions, not hollow words, but, don't [https://sites.google.com/view/unitystation-server-rules/server-rules power play].

3) Security goes before faithfulness, so if a fellow officer calls for backup or the [Head of Security](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Security_roles\Security-Officer.md) calls all units, you should respond immediately.

4) In no case you have the permission to shitcurity, if you do even once, people will remember that and avoid you.

## [Semper Aequus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_State_Police)

If you don't like any of those but do want to stay at security and manage paperwork then this is just the style for you. Stay at the department, at the front desk, oversee prisoners, make sure they get out on time, and stay put until then, be warden's right hand. Take into account this information:

1) Prisoners may give you a false sense of content by standing in place, but when you hear someone beating on the wall, know that's them.

2) If you detect a break out, immediately close the shutters if they're open, just in case.

3) When manning the front desk, and someone requests a baton, make sure they have proper reasoning, and alert level.

4) If situation goes out of control you might have to get out of your cozy seat and go out to hunt some criminals, or stay home to defend the fort.

5) If an officer brings in a law breaker ask them what they're in for and handle the procedure yourself, following the [Space Law](\3_HowToPlay\Guides\Security_guides\Space-Law.md).

# Space Law
Space Law is a collection of rules and regulations enacted by Nanotrasen which has oversight through CentCom and is enforced by the [Sec Officers](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Security) on the station. Space Law applies to all ranks and positions on station, from the lowliest Assistant to the highest Captain, all are equal under the eyes of the Law and ultimately answer to her.

*The rules and regulations herein are not absolutes, instead they exist to serve mainly as **guidelines** for the law and order of the dynamic situations that exist for stations on the frontiers of space, as such some leeway is permitted.*

###  Interpretation of the Law

A good working knowledge of Space Law is important for any person on the station. It can be the difference between a shiny pair of handcuffs and sipping Gargle Blasters in the bar. More in depth interpretations of space law are required for such positions as the Lawyer, Warden, HoP, and the HoS. While it is unlikely that the officers will listen particularly closely to your protestations, it may be enough to lighten your sentence and avoid ill treatment by security.

For certain crimes, the accused's intent is important. The difference between Assault and Attempted Murder can be very hard to ascertain, and, when in doubt, you should default to the less serious crime. It is important to note though, that Assault and Attempted Murder are mutually exclusive. You cannot be charged with Assault and Attempted Murder from the same crime as the intent of each is different. Likewise, 'Assault With a Deadly Weapon' and 'Assaulting an Officer' are also crimes that exclude others. Pay careful attention to the requirements of each law and select the one that best fits the crime when deciding sentence.

In the case of violent crimes (Assault, Manslaughter, Attempted Murder and Murder), and theft (Petty Theft, Pick-Pocketing, Theft, and Grand Theft) take only the most severe.

A single incident has a single sentence, so if, for instance, the prisoner took three items off of someone, this is a single count of pick-pocketing, if they pick-pocketed two people this would be two separate counts of pick-pocketing, and so on.

Aiding a criminal makes you an accomplice; you can be charged with the same crime as the person you aided.

Brig Procedures


**Standard Operational Procedures for brigging are as follows:**

1. Take the prisoner to the brig and inform the Warden of their crimes so their Security Record may be updated.
2. Take the prisoner to a brig cell, set the time and activate the timer.
3. Enter the cell with the prisoner in tow, open the cell locker and hold the prisoner over it.
4. Empty their pockets and remove their gloves, backpacks, tool belt, gas masks, and any flash resistant equipment such as Sunglasses, Welding Masks/Goggles, Space Helmets, etc.
5. Buckle the prisoner to the bed.
6. Search the items removed and be sure to check the internals box in their backpack.
7. Confiscate any contraband and/or stolen items, as well as any tools that may be used for future crimes. These are to be placed in evidence, **not left on the brig floor or your personal use**, until they can be returned to their rightful owners.
8. Close the locker and **lock it**.
9. Stun the prisoner, remove their cuffs, stun them again, pick up the cuffs then leave the cell.
10. Modify their brig sentence for additional offences or good behavior, if applicable.

**Do** *NOT* **fully strip the prisoner unless they have earned a permanent sentence.**

In the event of a sentence exceeding the 10 minute limit of the timer inform the Warden so he may add the rest of the time later.

In the instance of prisoners that have earned Labor Camp duty, you must dress them in orange overalls and assign them targets, based on their sentence, by getting a prison ID, putting it in a Prisoner Management Console, assigning their quota (with a conversion rate of 100 points per minute otherwise served in the brig) and then giving them the ID as you ship them to the Labor Camp. There are more details on this procedure at Labor Camp.**

***NOTE:** In the current revision of TG, Mineral spawn is heavily reduced in the gulag area. If you plan on using the gulag for several incidences [meaning the floors are already mined so people can't mine the floors for glass], you should use a lower conversion rate.*

The [Warden](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Warden) or [Head of Security](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Head_of_Security) are responsible for placing prisoners and in permanent confinement.

1. Permanent Prisoners are to be completely stripped of their belongings, which are to be held in either evidence or a prison locker.

2. The prisoner is to be dressed in an Orange Prison Jumpsuit and Shoes, which are found in the prison lockers.

3. Permanent Prisoners are not permitted to possess any personal belongings whilst they are incarcerated in the



   Prison Wing

   .

   1. The Labor Camp can also be used to hold Permanent Prisoners. Simply do not issue a prisoner ID when transferring them to the camp.

### Legal Representation and Trials


Prisoners are permitted to seek legal representation however you are under no obligation to provide or allow this.

Lawyers, and by extension the Head of Personnel, exist to serve as a guiding hand and the voice of reason within the judicial process, however they have zero authority over the brig, security personnel, prisoners, or sentencing.

The Lawyer's security headset is a privilege not a right. Security personnel are under no requirement to listen to them and security channel abuse is to result in that privilege being revoked.

If the lawyer continuously acts as a disruptive influence Security are fully permitted to confiscate their access, remove them from the brig and bar their future access to it.

In instances where a conflict of opinion arises over the sentence of a prisoner the chain of command **must** be followed. This goes, from top to bottom: Captain > Head of Security > Warden > Sec Officer / Detective.

Trials are not to be performed for Timed Sentences. This is mainly for the benefit of the accused as trials will often run many times the length of the actual sentence.

Trials may be performed for Capital Crimes and Permanent Detention, however there is no requirement to hold them. Forensic Evidence, Witness Testimony, or Confessions are all that is required for the Head of Security, Warden or Captain to authorize their sentence.

In cases where the Death Penalty is desired but the Captain or Acting-Captain is unable or unwilling to authorize the execution a trial **is required** to authorise the death penalty.

### Use of Deadly Force


As a member of the stations Security force you are one of the best armed and protected people on the station, equipped with the almost latest in non-lethal takedown technology.

It is for this reason that the situations that warrant the use of Deadly Force are few and far between, in the grand majority of circumstances you will be expected to use your stun weapons, which indeed are many times more effective than lethal options, to diffuse a situation.

There are a few circumstances where deadly force is permissible:

- **Code Red Situation** - situations which would warrant a Code Red, such as: full blown mutinies, hostile boarding parties, and Space Wizards automatically authorise lethal force. Note: The Alert Status is not required to be elevated to Code Red as in most of these scenarios the Chain of Command will be too damaged or otherwise occupied to raise the Alert Level.

- **Non-Lethal Weapons Ineffective** - certain targets are impervious to NLWs, such as Mechs, Xenomorphs, Borgs, and Hulks. Lethal force may be used against these targets if they prove hostile.

- Severe Personal Risk



  \- sometimes getting close enough to a target to slap the cuffs on will create significant personal risk to the Officer. Deadly force from range is recommended to subdue Wizards and Changelings.

  - Criminals in hostile environments such as space, fire, or plasma leaks also fall into this category, as do criminals believed to be in possession of high explosives. Ranged lethal force is the only reasonable option in these conditions.

- Armed and Dangerous



  \- if a suspect is in possession of weapons, including stun weapons, and you have reasonable suspicion that they will use these against you, lethal force is permitted. Although in the majority of cases it is still preferable to attempt to detain them non-lethally.

  - Unauthorized personnel in the armory are considered by default to be Armed and Dangerous, maximum force is permitted to subdue such targets.

- **Multiple Hostiles** - it can be extremely difficult to detain multiple hostiles. **As a last resort** if you are being mobbed you may deploy your baton in a harmful manner to thin the crowd. Generally it is better to retreat and regroup than stand your ground.

Additionally, in the event of an attempted prison break, Security may fire lasers through the glass. They are expected to first fire a few warning shots before unloading their weapon into the target.



### Minor Crimes

All of these crimes carry a 1 minute sentence.

| Code |                                                              | Crime                 | Description                                                  | Notes                                                        |

This counts for general areas of the ship, and trespass in restricted areas is a more serious crime. | Remember that people can either break in, sneak in, or be let in. Always check that the suspect wasn't let in to do a job by someone with access, or were given access on their ID. Trespassing and theft are often committed together; both sentences should be applied. |



### Medium Crimes

All of these crimes carry a 2 minute sentence or a 100 point target at the Labor Camp, optional for the suspect you are arresting.

| Code |                                                              | Crime                           | Description                                                  | Notes                                                        |

### Major Crimes

These crimes carry a service at the Labor Camp, with a 500 point target or a five minute brig sentence.

Life imprisonment is the most humane option for the insane who might malfunction as cyborgs. **Unauthorised executions are classed as Murder.** |

This is one of the few crimes where it is recommended to always seek a third party opinion. If their actions are determined to be for the betterment of Nanotrasen consider a timed sentence or even a full pardon. |
| 407  | [Compromising Station Integrity](Grand_Sabotage.pnh)         | **Grand Sabotage**           | To engage in maliciously destructive actions, seriously threatening crew or station. | Bombing, arson, releasing viruses, deliberately exposing areas to space, physically destroying machinery or electrifying doors all count as Grand Sabotage. |

Examples include: intelligence or research samples, the Hand Teleporter, the Captain's Antique Laser, the Captain or the HoP's ID cards, or Mechs. This is by no means a exhaustive list of items that are high value to the syndicate; when in doubt use common sense when you see certain items that are stolen that can cause massive problems throughout the station. Remember if something is locked up in a secure area it probably should not be taken without prior permission. |
| 411  | [File:Antag skum.png](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Antag_skum.png) | **Enemy of the Corporation** | To act as, or knowingly aid, an enemy of Nanotrasen.         | Current enemies of Nanotrasen currently include: The Syndicate (through secret agents, boarding parties, and brainwashing specialists), The Wizard Federation, The Changeling Hivemind, and The Cult of Nar'Sie.Note that this is one of the few crimes where you may summarily execute someone for if they present a significant risk to detain them. |
