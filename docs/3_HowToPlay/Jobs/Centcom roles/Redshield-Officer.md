# Redshield Officer
**Role type**: <font color= "#D4AF37">CentCom</font>. **Access**: <font color="green">Security and command</font>. **Difficulty**: <font color="Red">Extreme</font>.




## Who you are

Welcome, Redshield. You have been given special training by Central Command, and been dispatched to serve as the personal bodyguard of everyone with access to Command Comms.


Most of your time will be spent shadowing those you have been assigned to protect, making sure that they're alive and well, and keep an eye on a crew monitor to make sure they're still on sensors. Your job is to keep everyone in Command, as well as CentCom VIPs, alive.


One very important detail of your job is that you are not [Security](Security-Officer.md). Do not let your Security access fool you. You should not be concerned with the goings-on at Security, nor should you be doing their job for them. You are not a Security Officer with elevated access and snazzy outfit. You are a bodyguard.



## How to do your job

---

## Your gear

The Redshield does not come with much special equipment, being outfitted mostly as a security officer with a stylish beret. Depending on the whims of your [supervisors](Admin.md), you may, rarely, receive additional gear.
