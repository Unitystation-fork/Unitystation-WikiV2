# Cargonia

Cargonia is the current in-game name of this gamemode. A random department (excluding security and command) will become rogue and is tasked to steal an item and escape on the shuttle with at least 50% of the department staying alive until the end of the round.

The gamemode can currently only be triggered manually by an admin.

## Hail Cargonia!

This antagonist gamemode heavily emphasizes coordination. A typical round often involves a period of preparation and then an alpha strike on all fronts, though it can be done without ever alerting the rest of the station. The key is how well you exploit the tools available to your department.

## Cargo

The eponymous rogue department. With your own lathe, half a dozen hardsuits, the expeditionary shuttle, the almighty [PKA](Items/PKA), and the ability to buy whatever you want, you have it pretty good.

If you go the hostile-takeover route, your priority is to hoard as much money as possible to purchase the gear you need to succeed while ignoring requests from other departments, citing lack of funds or having them fill out needless and exuberant paperwork.

You will likely want to purchase some weapons crates to arm the proletariats of Cargonia. These crates come locked, requiring security clearance to open. One strategy to getting past this is dragging the crates outside the station airlocks and pinning them against a wall along an indentation. Once you have secured yourself on an opposite wall, shoot the crates with a [PKA](PKA.md) until they break, then take the goodies back inside. Barring that solution, you could also just ask the [HoP](HoP.md) for All Access; 50% of the time, it works every time.
