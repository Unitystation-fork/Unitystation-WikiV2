## Cult leadership and you!

The chaplains job is simple, you can form and follow whatever crazy religion you want! invent absurd and crazy rituals! Sacrifice volunteers to the eldritch ones! convert the crew into emperor worshiping zealots! so long as your within the bounds of reason and the rules, your basically free to do whatever you want, as the chaplain job has no set duties(as of now). if your successful and loyal enough, you may even attract the attention of whatever deity you follow.

### Bell, book, and candle

There's some neat hidden features of the chaplain that you might not know about.

First, the chaplain's Null rod has the ability to transform into a choice of a huge list of religious weapons, allowing you to pick one that matches closer to your god's flavour. They each have different stats, and most are quite robust.

Second, the holy book has the ability to heal people. You can treat up to 10 brute and burn damage at a time by bashing the book on another character's head on help intent. This does come with some risk, as every bonk has a 40% chance to instead deal 10 brain damage, which is very difficult to treat, so use it sparingly.

### Some things to do

Due to a lack of set goals, you may be a tad overwhelmed, however, here are some ideas

* Recruit followers into your religion.
