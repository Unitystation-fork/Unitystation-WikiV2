You are the mime, the silent type. you are bound by oath to keep your mouth shut and only express yourself through gestures using /me. Should you fail to keep your mouth shut, you'll likely end up suffering consequences ranging anywhere from annoyance to death. Your job is supposed to be t entertain the crew, but nobody will egg you on to do that. in practice, you are more or less a handicapped assistant, in that you cant scream for help.

A mime has a variety of unique mime-specific tools and gear, such as his mask, uniform, backpack, and the bottle of nothing in his pack. The latter can be used by the bartender to make drinks. The Clown will often be either your best bud or greatest nemesis, as has been the case ever since the foundation of the clown and mime federation, the latter falling apart as they couldn't pass any laws.
