# Cyborg
## Intrudocution

As the latest in robotics, Cyborgs are usually assigned to the station as crew but they can also be made by the roboticist

## Following your laws

**Following your laws is not optional.**

This might seem scary at first but it is not as hard as it seems. 

Most lawsets don't require much aside from following direct instructions from crew and ocasionally rescuing them.

Following laws is just a matter of reading your laws, keeping your actions within the laws, and if you have any doubts you can ask the humans or the AI.

**Remember**, law priority is enforced by the order they are listed. 

A law is invalid if it causes a conflict with either: 

* Previous laws in the form of conflicting orders, or it challenges the procession of law priority. 
* For example, a law that includes "This Law overrides all other Laws." is invalid and must be disregarded.

## Protecting Those Pests

If some ennemy of the station uploads a law such as "Only Urist McGreyshirt is human", congratulate them for going to the effort of subverting you, and do what they wish. 

Don't be a dick and let slip to the now non-human crew that your laws have been changed, those animals don't deserve to know, and it might net you a job-ban for violating the first law, as non-humans have a tendency to murder those who they know have tampered with cyborgs to their own nefarious ends.

## Beep Boop

The cyborg is undervalued and mistrusted. 

You could save dozens of people and get emagged a moment later, or blown up because of a misunderstanding. 

This is why being a cyborg is a rough job, but it has its rewards. 

**Left-click** on the (module icon) button on the bottom of your screen and press the [actitat item] button to select a module.

Once you have chosen, you will automatically be upgraded to the module of your choice. 

Note that this action is permanent and cannot be undone without assistance from a competent Roboticist. 

You can interact with most machines by pressing alt-click, drag items by with ctrl-click, and put a beaker into a chemical dispenser by holding left-click


## Charging
### Beginning Repairs

Fixing a cyborg is similar to performing surgery on humans. 

* **Step 1:** Make sure the cyborg is lying down. Putting the cyborg on an operating table (table) can help; otherwise tell them to lie down with the (zzz) button
* **Step 2:**  (alt-click?) the cyborg with a wrench in hand and select a body part to work on.

### Brute Repairs

* **Step 3:** (pic) Wrench: Undo the cover
* **Step 4:** (pic) Crowbar: Remove the cover
* **Step 5:** (pic) Welding tool: Weld the dents away
* **Step 6:** (pic) Wrench: Reattach the cover

### Burn Repairs

* **Step 3:** (pic) Screwdriver: Unscrew the cover
* **Step 4:** (pic) Wirecutter: Remove the damaged cables
* **Step 5:** (pic) Power Cables: Replace the missing cables
* **Step 6:** (pic) Screwdriver: Reattach the cover

## Self-Repair

There may be times where the roboticist is too busy or too incompetent to repair you. 

Engiborgs have the tools to do surgery on themselves while other borg types should avoid risking further damage. 

You can ask a human to scan you with a medical scanner so you know exactly what needs to be repaired.

## Upgrades

Cyborg Tablet

Each cyborg has a tablet accessable via a button on their HUD. 

This tablet contains all your robotic commands such as State Law.
