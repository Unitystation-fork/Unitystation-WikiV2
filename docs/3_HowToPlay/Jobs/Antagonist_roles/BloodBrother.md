#  [Blood Brothers](Blood Brothers) 
In Blood Brothers two players are spawned as "Brothers" with each other. 

They work with the syndicate similar to [Traitor|Traitors](Traitor|Traitors) and [Nuclear Operative|Nukies](Nuclear Operative|Nukies), however their uplink is given much less TC. 

## lore
The lore is that two brothers came from a prison where they were experimented on giving them more health and a special spell or paranoia. 

## objective
The objective of the Blood Brothers is to complete at least 70% of their objectives (which are about the same as the ones Traitors get), however if one of the brothers dies they both die. 
This is Unitystation's unique take on the gamemode of the same name from classic [SS13](https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Traitor#Blood_Brothers "SS13")
With the players being linked together it focuses on more cooperation between the two brothers for better or for worse.
