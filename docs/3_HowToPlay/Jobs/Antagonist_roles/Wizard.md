Role type:  <font color= "#711e25">Antagonist</font>. Access levels: <font color="#711e25">anywhere they can teleport to</font>, Difficulty: <font color="Red">hard</font>.

Space Wizards are a unique antagonist who has access to magical powers that defy scientific principles. Most are part of the Space Wizard Federation, a mysterious organization that is at war with NanoTrasen. The source of the wizard's power is their spellbook, which they consult to master a variety of spells to cast to cause chaos and devastation.

As the wizard, you will be given quite a few objectives (typically 4) to complete that will require you to steal high-risk items and assassinate crew members. Even as an almighty wizard, master of time and space, you are ultimately just as squishy and vulnerable as any other person. So, if you are to complete your objectives and survive to the end of the round, you will still have to demonstrate a high degree of cleverness to get the job done.

**Understand that the Wizard is a work-in-progress antagonist, and does not have all of their abilties in game yet. Still, there's plenty to have fun with; enjoy your superiority over the station.**

## Spells

| Spell Name     | Cost | Cooldown | description | Invocation |
| -------------------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| **Offensive Spells** |      |          | Used to kill or otherwise injure others             |            |
| Fireball | 2 spell points | 6 seconds | Summons an explosive fireball. When thrown, it will explode upon hitting a target, dealing a high amount of fire damage. Maximum range 8 tiles |ONI'SOMA! |
| Lesser Summon Guns | 3 spell points | 75 seconds | Summon a Surplus rifle in hand. Several other rifles pop out of worm holes around the wizard. |  |
| Lighting Bolt | 1 spell point | 10 seconds | Summon lighting from your hands. Generally low damage, but the potential increases when you fire it into groups, as the lightning will arc from your target to others nearby. A good budget damage option. | P'WAH, UNLIMITED P'WAH |
| Spell Blade | 2 spell points | N/A | Delivered via a drop pod landing on the wizard's tile. **Move out of the way or you will be crushed.** A laser-flinging sword; decently robust. The projectiles it fire are armor piercing and recharge quickly, giving you a decent solution for protracted gunfights as a wizard. |  |
| **Defensive** |        |         | Used to protect yourself ||
| Forcewall | 1 spell point | 10 seconds | Summon a 3x1 wall that you can walk through. | TARCOL MINTI ZHER! |
| Rockdrop | 1 spell point | 45 seconds | Drop rocks on your enemies. The tile you click will get hit with a movement-blocking rock while smaller passable rocks will rain down around it randomly. Does low damage, but the large rock does more. Can be used in creative ways, such as to block off areas or to provide yourself cover from projectiles. The rocks can be mined away with a pickaxe. | BALDERDASH! |
| Mastercrafted Armor Set | 2 spell points | N/A | Delivered via a drop pod landing on the wizard's tile. **Move out of the way or you will be crushed.** A magic-encrusted spacesuit. It slows you down a bit, but it provides good armor. | |
| Stunning Bolt | 2 spell points | 1.5 seconds | It lets you fire a stunning electrode exactly like a taser, though with a longer maximum range. It's quick cooldown allows you to spam it annoyingly fast. | LIGHTNINGBOLT!! |
| **Mobility Spells** |  |  |Allow for more rapid movement, it is STRONGLY advised to take at least one  |  |
| Teleport | 2 spell points | 60 seconds | Instantly teleport to a chosen location anywhere on your Z-level. | SCYAR NILA! |
| Blink | 2 spell points | 2 seconds | _randomly_ teleport a medium distance. It will _try_ to not teleport the wizard into space, but it will sometimes, so be prepared. | |
