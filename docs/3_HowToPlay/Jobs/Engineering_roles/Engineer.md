## Overview

Engineers are the repairmen and electricians of the station. If there's a hole in the station providing one of the hallways or departments with a fresh view of space, it's the Engineer's job to fix it. If wires have been cut and half the station is out of power, it's the Engineer's job to fix it.

As an Engineer, people expect you to know at least the basics of Construction, how the power system works and how to lay wires, etc. If you're ever confused on what to do, ask the [Chief Engineer](Chief-Engineer.md). They should give you advice, since they are your superior and it's their job to coordinate and assist engineers.

At the bare minimum, you must know how to fix a hull breach and how to turn on the SMES. Learn how to do these as an assistant to the [CE](Chief-Engineer.md) before you play as the only engineer on a low population server. Otherwise, you will have a really angry station on your back.
### Bob the Builder

this is just a very basic guide to how the construction system works. for a more in-depth guide, see [Construction](Construction.md).

In Unitystation, there are three materials you'll need to worry about: Metal Plates, Glass Sheets, and Metal Rods. There are some more, but these are the ones you'll most often be using. In order to craft/construct something, have a material selected in your hand, and either press Z or click on it in your hand. This will open a construction menu where you can select what item to build. Keep in mind some items will need more materials than others, for example a department battery will need 30 metal plates where as a girder will only need 2.

Once you've clicked on the item you want to build, wait for the bar above your head to fill up, and boom, you've built the item you want to build. Another note is that some items in the construction menu are intermediary constructions that must be finished with additional construction. For example, to build a wall requires you to construct a metal girder with 2 metal sheets, then finish the wall by clicking on the girder with 2 more sheets.

Construction materials will go very fast, especially with a full engineering department. It will likely be necessary to order more materials from [Cargo](Quartermaster.md). If you have a [CE](Chief-Engineer.md), get in touch with them about what you need. Their status as a head will get things ordered and shipped faster. However, the [Shaft Miners](Shaft-Miner.md) [might](So-close-to-impossible-that-it-might-as-well-not-even-exist.md) randomly show up with a humongous shipment of construction materials, both basic and exotic, to let you go nuts with. Be thankful you don't have to share them with [Science](Roboticist.md) yet.


### Electricity

An Engineer's job is also to keep the station powered. At the beginning of the round, the station will have some power available in the SMESs, but it won't last long. It is your responsibility to **start the engine.**

Different maps will have different engines for you to work with. The plasma generator is pretty typical and easy to set up. On some maps it will have to be taken out of storage, but you wrench it onto the high voltage power line that feeds into the transformer and then you power it on. In most stations, a crate of plasma will be available to you at round start, but the rest of engineering's stockpile is usually kept locked by shutters, unlockable only by the Chief Engineer. If someone complains about the lack of power despite the generator being fine, head to the area without power and make sure the wiring hasn't been cut.

The alternative choices to powering the station are much more complicated, and can go horribly wrong if you don't manage things closely. It is highly recommended to not mess with them without having read the guides or having a more experienced engineer walk you through the steps.

### Tools


Engineers get given a set of tools, both in their toolbelt and in toolboxes stored around the department. These include:

*A Crowbar, for prying up floor tiles and prying open stuck doors and firelocks.
*A Screwdriver, for detaching windows, grilles, and dismantling unsecured girders.
*A Welder, for detaching the plates from walls and making repairs to damaged components.
*A Wrench, for securing and unsecuring items (such as vents, girders, plasma tanks [when in a shuttle's fuel slot], etc.)
*A Wirecutter, for cutting wires and destroying grilles
*A Multitool, used for connecting electrical machine to an APC and a variety of niche purposes. Also used for hacking.
*High, medium, and low voltage wires.
*

In addition, on most stations, each Engineer gets their own hardsuit. Cherish your birthright and never take it off. It will save your life.

### Traitorneering ([traitor](traitor.md) engineer)

A [traitor](traitor.md) engineer isn't as easy as you might think it is. While you do have good access, a lot of useful equipment (including a hardsuit), and a generally effective excuse to be in lots of places you aren't supposed to ("just making repairs!"), you critically don't get access to any swanky weapons. No matter where you go, you also have a responsibility *to look busy.* Lingering around a place for too long without doing anything will very quickly arouse suspicions, so find things to do.

# Construction

Construction and deconstruction are essential tools for [Engineers](engineer.md) and [Traitors](traitor.md) alike. For most of the buildings, the only thing you must do is activate the required materials in your hand (via pressing z or just clicking them).

A main feature of Unitystation is that almost any item in the game can be either ordered from the [quartermaster](quartermaster.md), or built with materials. As this game is a work-in-progress, we're not quite there yet. But here are some things you can build and deconstruct, though.

# Guide to electricity
Relevent guides: [Construction](Construction.md) , [Nuclear Reactor](Guide-to-the-nuclear-reactor.md)

Note: This is not a guide to the operation of the nuclear reactor or building electrical equipment, that is linked directly above.

## Overview
Electricity in US is a system that appears very complex on the surface but is in reality very simple to understand. This guide will cover safety, electricity consuming devices, types of wires,
APCs (not the armoured vehicles), department/local batteries, transformers, station power storage, and simple generators as well as how to sabotage and repair the electrical grid.

## How not to become a lightbulb
As in real life, high voltages and large amounts of power are dangerous, and can very easily kill you if not respected. To remain safe while fixing or destroying the power grid, there
are several things you can do. The most potent and capable defence against electrical shocks is insulated gloves, which are able to block almost all form of electrical shocks, the budget
variety offers some protection as well, but nowhere near the guaranteed protection of the engineering-grade ones. Cutting and merging powered wires without gloves will almost always
result in shocks that deal large amounts of burn damage, scaling with the power involved, which can easily kill you. if you do not have access to gloves, you can try to shut down power
to the wires to safely connect/cut them by interacting with power controllers, such as the APC, department battery, or station power source.

## Power Consuming Devices
Most devices on the station, from consoles to the bar dispenser all require a constant supply of power to function. If the power supply collapses or the demand for power exceeds generated power,
these devices will stop working, effectively halting the station. All lightbulbs require power, and not powering the lights is a sure-fire way to invoke the broken window effect. Cloning will
also not function without power, meaning dead bodies will pile up and not be revived.

## Types of Wires
Rather than a single type of wire, the station's power supply is made of a network of many types of wires. Low voltage wires are cheap, but can only handle smaller amounts of power.
Medium power wires are the most common type of wire and are used in [hacking](Hacking-Guide.md) doors. High voltage wires are the rarest type of wires and can handle the enormous loads made by
nuclear reactors and generators, they act as the spine upon which the rest of the station's grid is built.

## Area Power Controllers (APCs)
These devices (most of them) receive power from their local APC. APCs can be found just about everywhere, and typically control the power distribution of a single room. If an APC is receiving power,
it will automatically distribute it to other devices. Devices not powered by an APC can instead be powered by a physical wire connection to a power supply. APCs themselves are connected by low voltage wires
to department batteries. If clicked on, they will open a menu, on which you can read various statistics about the APC.

## Department Batteries
Department batteries, as the name implies, control the power distribution of power to larger department sized areas. They do not power machines themselves, instead, they connect
to APCs which distribute power for them. Department batteries are connected by Medium voltage wires back to the engineering department, where they are connected
to SMES devices. Batteries can be turned on and off by clicking on them.

## SMES devices
SMES devices are effectively just upscaled department batteries. They distribute power to department batteries through medium voltage wires. They receive their power from
Transformers, to which they are connected by medium-voltage wires. When clicked on they open a menu from which how much power they store and how much they distribute per tick can
be altered.

## Transformers
Transformers are simple, in effect, they are just a way of linking high voltage wires with medium voltage wires. they do not have a menu when clicked on and cannot be turned on or off.
They serve an important role in allowing the station's power source to connect to SMES devices which distribute the power it generates.

## Simple generators
Unlike the reactor, generators are incredibly simple. they produce a large amount of electricity by burning solid plasma, but require a constant supply to function. plasma can be
inserted into generators by clicking the generator with plasma in hand. generators can then be turned on by clicking them. The amount of power produced by generators is so large
that not even insulated gloves, or even the captain's gloves, will protect you when cutting directly connected wires, they can and will kill you instantly. if you need to change
the wiring, turn the generator off first.

## Diagnostics and repair
All too often electrical devices may find themselves unpowered due to issues in the gird. Fortunately, there is an easy step by step guide that can be used to fix almost any electrical
issue.

0: if the station is unpowered, skip to step 3. if a department is unpowered, skip to step 2. otherwise move to step 1.

1: Check the APC for the room the device is in. If it is receiving power, your device is simply not connected. try moving it. occasionally a devices power requirements may
exceed what an APC can provide, in which case, you should manually link it using medium-voltage wires to the stations medium voltage wire grid. if the APC is not receiving power, move to step two

2: Follow the APC's low voltage wiring to the department battery. on the way, check for any breaks in the wires. cut wires, obviously, will not transmit power. Mice will often nibble
at power cables, so killing mice in maint is recommended. If the connection to the battery is broken, repair it and check the APC. if the APC is powered but the device isn't, move back to
step one. If the APC is still not receiving power, Move to check the department battery. if it is off, turn it on. check if the battery is distributing stored power, or if it is actually
receiving power. If it is the prior, move on to step three, if the device still isn't working, return to step one.

3: Either badger an engineer to check power, or do so yourself. engineering is restricted to non-engineers, so it is often best simply letting one fix the problem for you. to fix the issue of the battery
not being supplied, follow its medium-voltage wires to the SMESs. repair any breaks. If there were breaks and you repaired them, check if the battery is receiving power or the device works.
If the prior is false, repeat step two, if the latter is false move to step one. If the connection is solid, check the SMESs themselves and see if they are receiving and distributing power.
If the SMESs are not receiving power, move onto step 4, if they are not distributing it, fix it and move to step one.

4:Follow the connection to the reactor/generator. Make sure there is a transformer making the power wires transition from medium to high, and that there are no breaks.
If there are breaks, fix them, and return to step 3. If there are no breaks and power is still not distributed, check to see if the generator/reactor is operating, if it isn't,
fix it. if power is still not distributed, return to step three.

## power sabotage
The station's power supply is remarkably fragile, and a single man with access to maintenance and a wirecutter can easily cripple multiple departments. Low voltage wires to APCs can
be cut to disrupt single rooms, and while not very crippling are rarely fixed. Medium wires and batteries supply entire departments, and if broken or cut can stop it from functioning.
Finally, Destroying the generator, SMESs, cutting SMES wires, or cutting generator-transformer wires can all cut power to the entire station.

# Hacking Guide

## Spoiler-free Hacking Tips [as of build 4105]

Use a screwdriver on a door (on any [intent](Intent.md)) to open the panel. Clicking on the door with wires, or a wirecutter in hand will open the hacking interface. The panel can be closed again by using a screwdriver on the door a second time, making it less evident that the door has been tampered with.

Door hacking poses a risk of electric shock, so insulated gloves are a good idea!

The panel contains two rows of sockets with several wires running between them. Clicking on a wire with cutters selected will cut and remove it. With an empty hand selected, clicking an empty socket in the bottom row followed by one in the top row will connect the two sockets with a wire.

Try cutting a wire, trying the door out, then replacing the wire as you found it. Take note of any differences between the effects of cutting different individual wires. Experiment further by isolating and working with wires associated with a single type of behavior.

Try moving around a wire's connection point on one end only--either the top or bottom row.

Once you have a success, try replicating it with another door.

Take it one step at a time--If you break a door irrecoverably, move on to a different one and try being more slow and methodical in your experimentation.

The same colored wire will do the same thing on every door.

The positions of the wires will be randomized though.

Have a good excuse ready for when the [Head of Security](Head-of-Security.md) (inevitably) wanders by while you're up to your yellow-gloved wrists in buzzing, sparking wires.

You may want to start with some door off in maint, where no one can catch you.

### Some important types of wires

| Wire | Description
| --- | --- |
| Power | This wire provides power to the door. When cut you can open the door with a crowbar. |
| Shock | When cut, the door shocks anyone who interacts with it without gloves. |
| Bolt | When cut, the door becomes bolted |

Figuring out the door wiring can take a minute or two initially, but it's well worth the time investment, as a working pattern can be repeated with additional doors in seconds.
