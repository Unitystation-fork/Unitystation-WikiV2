# Station Artificial Intelligence
**Role type**: <font color="#a85fb9">Synthetic.</font> **Access**: <font color="green">Everything</font>. **Difficulty**: <font color="Red">medium to hard</font>.

## Overview

You're the massive computer system with near total control NanoTrasen has foolishly released onto their latest research station. The life of the AI consists largely of two fun and enriching activities: tracking people and opening doors. But you have a lot of power, and a lot of responsibility. There's just the issue of those pesky Asimov laws...


### The Laws of Robotics

As an AI, you'll eventually find yourself in a position where you're forced to make a difficult choice based on your IC laws and OOC player expectations. In these cases, the best thing you can do is be logical about your choice, and a-help for admin advice if you're unsure.

Above all else, **consistency is key**: pick an interpretation of your laws and stick to it for the entirety of the round.


### Servicing the crew

Now it's time to get down to the nitty-gritty. You have a lot more power (and with it, responsibility) than the average crewmember. Time to start figuring out what you're made of.

The AI has the ability to access every *electronic* mechanism on the entire station. These include things like Airlocks, APCs, Computers, and Fire Alarms. However, the AI cannot operate anything *physically*, and can be rendered useless in one area due to a simple power outage.

Besides saving the crew from itself, a lot of what you're going to be doing is opening doors.

### Your home: the AI Satellite

The station AI starts inside the maximum security AI satellite, a chamber designed to keep the AI safe, secure, and out of the hands of [nefarious](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Antagonist_roles\Traitor.md) or [grabby](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Service_roles\Assistant.md) types. Inside the AI satellite will be your room protected by a number of automatic laser turrets. These turrets shoot anyone on sight unless they have been disabled by accesses a small turret control screen, either by you or by a head of staff. The turret controller can also toggle the turret fire modes from stun to kill.

There will usually be several layers of defense in the AI satellite, as well as the AI upload room, which contains a terminal for uploading new laws to the AI.

### Binary chat

As an AI, you have your own secure radio channel (binary) to speaking with other synthetics. Given that Cyborgs are still MIA, the only time you will get use out of this is in the uncommon, but possible scenario of a station with two or more AI cores. This currently only happens due to Admin fiat, but may become a more common scenarios once station AIs are constructable by [Roboticists.](\3_HowToPlay\Jobs\Science_roles\Roboticist.md)
