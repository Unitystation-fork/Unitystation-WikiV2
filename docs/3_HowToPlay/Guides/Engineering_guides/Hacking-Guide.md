## Spoiler-free Hacking Tips [as of build 4105]

Use a screwdriver on a door (on any [intent](Intent.md)) to open the panel. Clicking on the door with wires, or a wirecutter in hand will open the hacking interface. The panel can be closed again by using a screwdriver on the door a second time, making it less evident that the door has been tampered with.

Door hacking poses a risk of electric shock, so insulated gloves are a good idea!

The panel contains two rows of sockets with several wires running between them. Clicking on a wire with cutters selected will cut and remove it. With an empty hand selected, clicking an empty socket in the bottom row followed by one in the top row will connect the two sockets with a wire. 

Try cutting a wire, trying the door out, then replacing the wire as you found it. Take note of any differences between the effects of cutting different individual wires. Experiment further by isolating and working with wires associated with a single type of behavior.

Try moving around a wire's connection point on one end only--either the top or bottom row.

Once you have a success, try replicating it with another door.

Take it one step at a time--If you break a door irrecoverably, move on to a different one and try being more slow and methodical in your experimentation.

The same colored wire will do the same thing on every door. 

The positions of the wires will be randomized though. 

Have a good excuse ready for when the [Head of Security](Head-of-Security.md) (inevitably) wanders by while you're up to your yellow-gloved wrists in buzzing, sparking wires.

You may want to start with some door off in maint, where no one can catch you. 

### Some important types of wires

| Wire | Description
| --- | --- |
| Power | This wire provides power to the door. When cut you can open the door with a crowbar. |
| Shock | When cut, the door shocks anyone who interacts with it without gloves. |
| Bolt | When cut, the door becomes bolted |

Figuring out the door wiring can take a minute or two initially, but it's well worth the time investment, as a working pattern can be repeated with additional doors in seconds.
