# Standard Operating Procedure

## <font color= "#green">Code Green - All Clear</font>.

Standard operating level. No immediate or clear threat to the station. All departments may carry out work as normal.

- Weapons worn by security are to be hidden except when in the case of an emergency.
- Crew members may freely walk in the hallways.
- Security must respect the privacy of crew members and no unauthorized searches are allowed.

## <font color= "blue">Code Blue - Confirmed Threat</font>.

Elevated alert level. There are reports or other proof available to indicate that there is a threat to the station. When a Centcom threat summary is received and printed at communication consoles (happens automatically every roundstart), the blue alert level is applied. This pretty much means that this is the _actual_ standard operating procedure.

- Security may have weapons visible.
- Crew members may be searched by security with probable cause.
- the AI may bolt down high-risk areas.
- Energy guns, laser guns and riot gear are allowed to be given out to security personnel if the HoS or Warden agree.

Maximum alert level. There is an immediate threat to the station or severe damage. Martial Law is in effect.

- Security can raid departments and arrest any crew member deemed a threat to the station.
- All station personnel that are not members of Command or Security must remain in their departments.
- the AI may bolt down any threatened sectors as it sees fit.

## <font color= "#purple">Code Delta - Imminent Destruction</font>.

The station's self destruct mechanism has been engaged due to overwhelming threat to the station. Martial Law is in effect.

- All orders from Heads of Staff and Security must be followed, any disobedience is punishable by death.
- All crew members are to evacuate immediately, if possible.
