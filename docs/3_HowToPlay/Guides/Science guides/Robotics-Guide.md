# Robotics Guide

## Summary

So you're interested in making robots? Great! This guide will explain to you everything you need to know about making them

(don't expect a fancy page, i only know the absolute basics about making a wiki page)

## Items 

This section will explain every item you (currently) need in order to make robots. The items needed for robot creation are as followed:

* Metal sheets, for making proximity sensors and cyborg parts with the Exosuit fabricator
* Proximity sensors and Cyborg arms, for actually making the robots (floor bots and medical bots 'need' right arms, keep this in mind)
* An empty toolbox, for making Floor bots
* Floor tiles, for making Floor bots (10 needed per robot)
* An empty Medkit, for making Medical bots
* A Health analyzer, for making Medical bots
* An Empty Bucket, for making Cleaning bots

## Machinery

Currently, only one usable Robotics machine exists: the Exosuit Fabricator, which can be used to make cyborg parts as long as you have metal sheets inserted.


## Creating robots

Now that you know the materials and machines needed, let's get started



**Making robot parts**

1. Insert Metal Sheets into the Exosuit Fabricator. 50 sheets gives 100K iron

2. Click on the fabricator and go to either Cyborg parts or Miscellaneous

3. Make either a cyborg arm (i suggest making right arms) or a proximity sensor, depending on which tab you entered

4. Go back to the main menu of the fabricator. If you went to Cyborg Parts on step 2, go to Miscellaneous. If you went to Miscellaneous on step 2, go to Cyborg Parts

5. Again, depending on which tab you entered in step 4, make either an arm or a sensor

6. Click Process Queue, and the fabricator should start building the parts

   

## Making robots themselves

Now that we have robot parts, we're ready to make robots.

## Cleaning bots

1. Drop an empty bucket onto the ground

2. Click on the bucket with a Proximity Sensor

3. Click on the Robot Parts with a cyborg arm

Congratulations! You now have a Cleaning bot.

## Floor bots

1. Drop an empty toolbox onto the ground

2. Click on the toolbox with 10 floor tiles

3. Click on the robot parts with a Proximity Sensor

4. Click on the robot parts with a Right Cyborg arm



Congratulations! You now have a Clean bot.

## Medical bots

1. Drop an empty first aid kit or fire aid kit onto the ground
2. Click on the kit with a Right Cyborg arm
3. Click on the robot parts with a Health Analyzer

Click on the robot parts with a Proximity Sensor

Congratulations! You now have a Medical bot.
