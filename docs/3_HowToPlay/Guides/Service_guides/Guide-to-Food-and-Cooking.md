# Guide to Food and Cooking

## Understanding Nutrition =

In Unitystation, every character has a nutrition value that determines how full their stomach is. The nutrition value goes from 1 to 500, and every character has 400 nutrition at the start of a round. You will receive different messages in the chat log and possibly effects depending on how much nutrition you have.

- 500 Nutrition: "You're stuffed!", you won't be able to eat any more food at this point.
- 300 Nutrition: "You're satiated.", no effect.
- 200 Nutrition: "You feel hungry.", no effect.
- 100 Nutrition: "Your stomach rumbles violently.", no effect.
- 000 Nutrition: "Your malnourished body aches!", you start to slow down!

You will gradually lose nutrition over time, though different actions cause different amounts of nutrition loss. Running around will cause you to go hungrier faster than walking around or staying still.

## Food

## Bowl

Using a Bowl you can create some simple dough. To do that, combine 15 units of flour and 10 units of water in a bowl. Left-click an item to put it into your hand and then left-click on the bowl to pour your ingredients. You can change the amount of units per use by left-clicking on an item in your hand. If you want to go further you can then turn the dough into a flat dough by having the dough in one of your hands and left-clicking it with a rollingpin with the other hand. Do the same with a Knife and you get 3 dough slices which in turn can be turned into buns through the Microwave.
