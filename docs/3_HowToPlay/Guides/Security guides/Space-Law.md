# Space Law
Space Law is a collection of rules and regulations enacted by Nanotrasen which has oversight through CentCom and is enforced by the [Sec Officers](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Security) on the station. Space Law applies to all ranks and positions on station, from the lowliest Assistant to the highest Captain, all are equal under the eyes of the Law and ultimately answer to her.

*The rules and regulations herein are not absolutes, instead they exist to serve mainly as **guidelines** for the law and order of the dynamic situations that exist for stations on the frontiers of space, as such some leeway is permitted.*

###  Interpretation of the Law

A good working knowledge of Space Law is important for any person on the station. It can be the difference between a shiny pair of handcuffs and sipping Gargle Blasters in the bar. More in depth interpretations of space law are required for such positions as the Lawyer, Warden, HoP, and the HoS. While it is unlikely that the officers will listen particularly closely to your protestations, it may be enough to lighten your sentence and avoid ill treatment by security.

For certain crimes, the accused's intent is important. The difference between Assault and Attempted Murder can be very hard to ascertain, and, when in doubt, you should default to the less serious crime. It is important to note though, that Assault and Attempted Murder are mutually exclusive. You cannot be charged with Assault and Attempted Murder from the same crime as the intent of each is different. Likewise, 'Assault With a Deadly Weapon' and 'Assaulting an Officer' are also crimes that exclude others. Pay careful attention to the requirements of each law and select the one that best fits the crime when deciding sentence.

In the case of violent crimes (Assault, Manslaughter, Attempted Murder and Murder), and theft (Petty Theft, Pick-Pocketing, Theft, and Grand Theft) take only the most severe.

A single incident has a single sentence, so if, for instance, the prisoner took three items off of someone, this is a single count of pick-pocketing, if they pick-pocketed two people this would be two separate counts of pick-pocketing, and so on.

Aiding a criminal makes you an accomplice; you can be charged with the same crime as the person you aided.

Brig Procedures


**Standard Operational Procedures for brigging are as follows:**

1. Take the prisoner to the brig and inform the Warden of their crimes so their Security Record may be updated.
2. Take the prisoner to a brig cell, set the time and activate the timer.
3. Enter the cell with the prisoner in tow, open the cell locker and hold the prisoner over it.
4. Empty their pockets and remove their gloves, backpacks, tool belt, gas masks, and any flash resistant equipment such as Sunglasses, Welding Masks/Goggles, Space Helmets, etc.
5. Buckle the prisoner to the bed.
6. Search the items removed and be sure to check the internals box in their backpack.
7. Confiscate any contraband and/or stolen items, as well as any tools that may be used for future crimes. These are to be placed in evidence, **not left on the brig floor or your personal use**, until they can be returned to their rightful owners.
8. Close the locker and **lock it**.
9. Stun the prisoner, remove their cuffs, stun them again, pick up the cuffs then leave the cell.
10. Modify their brig sentence for additional offences or good behavior, if applicable.

**Do** *NOT* **fully strip the prisoner unless they have earned a permanent sentence.**

In the event of a sentence exceeding the 10 minute limit of the timer inform the Warden so he may add the rest of the time later.

In the instance of prisoners that have earned Labor Camp duty, you must dress them in orange overalls and assign them targets, based on their sentence, by getting a prison ID, putting it in a Prisoner Management Console, assigning their quota (with a conversion rate of 100 points per minute otherwise served in the brig) and then giving them the ID as you ship them to the Labor Camp. There are more details on this procedure at Labor Camp.**

***NOTE:** In the current revision of TG, Mineral spawn is heavily reduced in the gulag area. If you plan on using the gulag for several incidences [meaning the floors are already mined so people can't mine the floors for glass], you should use a lower conversion rate.*

The [Warden](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Warden) or [Head of Security](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Head_of_Security) are responsible for placing prisoners and in permanent confinement.

1. Permanent Prisoners are to be completely stripped of their belongings, which are to be held in either evidence or a prison locker.

2. The prisoner is to be dressed in an Orange Prison Jumpsuit and Shoes, which are found in the prison lockers.

3. Permanent Prisoners are not permitted to possess any personal belongings whilst they are incarcerated in the

    

   Prison Wing

   .

   1. The Labor Camp can also be used to hold Permanent Prisoners. Simply do not issue a prisoner ID when transferring them to the camp.

### Legal Representation and Trials


Prisoners are permitted to seek legal representation however you are under no obligation to provide or allow this.

Lawyers, and by extension the Head of Personnel, exist to serve as a guiding hand and the voice of reason within the judicial process, however they have zero authority over the brig, security personnel, prisoners, or sentencing.

The Lawyer's security headset is a privilege not a right. Security personnel are under no requirement to listen to them and security channel abuse is to result in that privilege being revoked.

If the lawyer continuously acts as a disruptive influence Security are fully permitted to confiscate their access, remove them from the brig and bar their future access to it.

In instances where a conflict of opinion arises over the sentence of a prisoner the chain of command **must** be followed. This goes, from top to bottom: Captain > Head of Security > Warden > Sec Officer / Detective.

Trials are not to be performed for Timed Sentences. This is mainly for the benefit of the accused as trials will often run many times the length of the actual sentence.

Trials may be performed for Capital Crimes and Permanent Detention, however there is no requirement to hold them. Forensic Evidence, Witness Testimony, or Confessions are all that is required for the Head of Security, Warden or Captain to authorize their sentence.

In cases where the Death Penalty is desired but the Captain or Acting-Captain is unable or unwilling to authorize the execution a trial **is required** to authorise the death penalty.

### Use of Deadly Force


As a member of the stations Security force you are one of the best armed and protected people on the station, equipped with the almost latest in non-lethal takedown technology.

It is for this reason that the situations that warrant the use of Deadly Force are few and far between, in the grand majority of circumstances you will be expected to use your stun weapons, which indeed are many times more effective than lethal options, to diffuse a situation.

There are a few circumstances where deadly force is permissible:

- **Code Red Situation** - situations which would warrant a Code Red, such as: full blown mutinies, hostile boarding parties, and Space Wizards automatically authorise lethal force. Note: The Alert Status is not required to be elevated to Code Red as in most of these scenarios the Chain of Command will be too damaged or otherwise occupied to raise the Alert Level.

- **Non-Lethal Weapons Ineffective** - certain targets are impervious to NLWs, such as Mechs, Xenomorphs, Borgs, and Hulks. Lethal force may be used against these targets if they prove hostile.

- Severe Personal Risk

   

  \- sometimes getting close enough to a target to slap the cuffs on will create significant personal risk to the Officer. Deadly force from range is recommended to subdue Wizards and Changelings.

  - Criminals in hostile environments such as space, fire, or plasma leaks also fall into this category, as do criminals believed to be in possession of high explosives. Ranged lethal force is the only reasonable option in these conditions.

- Armed and Dangerous

   

  \- if a suspect is in possession of weapons, including stun weapons, and you have reasonable suspicion that they will use these against you, lethal force is permitted. Although in the majority of cases it is still preferable to attempt to detain them non-lethally.

  - Unauthorized personnel in the armory are considered by default to be Armed and Dangerous, maximum force is permitted to subdue such targets.

- **Multiple Hostiles** - it can be extremely difficult to detain multiple hostiles. **As a last resort** if you are being mobbed you may deploy your baton in a harmful manner to thin the crowd. Generally it is better to retreat and regroup than stand your ground.

Additionally, in the event of an attempted prison break, Security may fire lasers through the glass. They are expected to first fire a few warning shots before unloading their weapon into the target.



### Minor Crimes

All of these crimes carry a 1 minute sentence.

| Code |                                                              | Crime                 | Description                                                  | Notes                                                        |

| 101  | [File:Resisting Arrest.PNG](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Resisting_Arrest.PNG) | **Resisting Arrest**  | To not cooperate with an officer who attempts a proper arrest. | Follow proper arrest procedure and have a legitimate cause to arrest in the first place before you brig a suspect for this. Suspects who scream bloody murder while being arrested are not cooperating. |
| 102  | [File:Indecent exposure.png](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Indecent_exposure.png) | **Indecent Exposure** | To be intentionally and publicly unclothed.                  | Running around the station naked. The mutual degradation of chasing a naked man down while he screams rape is only worth it on slow shifts. |
| 104  | [File:Libertycap.png](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Libertycap.png) | **Drug Possession**   | To possess space drugs or other narcotics by unauthorised personnel. | Botanists and MedSci staff are authorised to possess drugs for purposes of their jobs and are not subject to this law so long as they are not distributing or using them for profit or recreation. |
| 107  | [File:Vandalism.PNG](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Vandalism.PNG) | **Vandalism**         | To deliberately damage the station with malicious intent.    | Sentence depends on quantity of property damaged.            |
| 109  | [File:Trespassing.png](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Trespassing.png) | **Trespass**          | To be in an area which a person does not have access to. This counts for general areas of the ship, and trespass in restricted areas is a more serious crime. | Remember that people can either break in, sneak in, or be let in. Always check that the suspect wasn't let in to do a job by someone with access, or were given access on their ID. Trespassing and theft are often committed together; both sentences should be applied. |



### Medium Crimes

All of these crimes carry a 2 minute sentence or a 100 point target at the Labor Camp, optional for the suspect you are arresting.

| Code |                                                              | Crime                           | Description                                                  | Notes                                                        |

Assaults with deadly weapons are a higher crime. |
| 202  | [File:Pickpocketing.png](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Pickpocketing.png) | **Pick-Pocketing**              | To steal items from another's person.                        | Remember to take the stolen items from the person and arrange for their return. Stealing an ID is the most common and most serious form of pick-pocketing. |
| 203  | [File:Narcotics Distribution.PNG](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Narcotics_Distribution.PNG) | **Narcotics Distribution**      | To distribute narcotics and other controlled substances.     | Forcing or tricking someone to consume substances such as space drugs is assault. |
| 204  | [weapon](Possession_of_Weapon.png)                           | **Possession of a Weapon**      | To be in possession of a dangerous item that is not part of their job role. | Items capable of a high level of damage, such as saws, axes, and hatchets fit into this category. Do remember that if it is an item that is part of their job they are permitted to carry it. |
| 205 | [animals](ian.png) | **Cruelty to animals** | Animal cruelty, or animal abuse, is when a human being subjects an animal, whether wild, domestic, tame or held in captivity, to an act intended to harm it, whether in active or passive form, usually for pure pleasure . | Exemption for Strict Professional Necessity: - The geneticist on the monkeys if he is in his lab. - The cook in the scullery (non-public) ps: Ian arent a animal, it's a crewmate. |
| 206  | [File:Rioting.PNG](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Rioting.PNG) | **Rioting**                     | To partake in an unauthorised and disruptive assembly of crewmen that refuse to disperse. | It is required to order the crowd to disperse, failure to disperse is the crime not the assembly. Any crimes committed during the riot are considered separate offences. |
| 207  | [File:Workplace Hazard.PNG](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Workplace_Hazard.PNG) | **Creating a Workplace Hazard** | To endanger the crew or station through negligent or irresponsible, but not deliberately malicious, actions. | Good examples of this crime involves accidentally causing a plasma leak, slipping hazard, accidently electrifying doors, breaking windows to space, or Security personnel not keeping their equipment secure. |
| 208  | [File:Petty theft.png](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Petty_theft.png) | **Petty Theft**                 | To take items from areas one does not have access to or to take items belonging to others or the station as a whole. | Keeping items which are in short supply where they belong is what is important here. A doctor who takes all the surgical tools and hides them still commits theft, even though he had access. |
| 210  | [File:BandE.PNG](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=BandE.PNG) | **Breaking and Entry**          | Forced entry to areas where the subject does not have access to.

### Major Crimes

These crimes carry a service at the Labor Camp, with a 500 point target or a five minute brig sentence.

| Code |                                                              | Crime                                 | Description                                                  | Notes                                                        |

Officers should refrain from using lethal means to subdue the criminal if possible. |
| 303  | [File:Manslaughter.PNG](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Manslaughter.PNG) | **Manslaughter**                      | To unintentionally kill someone through negligent, but not malicious, actions. | Intent is important. Accidental deaths caused by negligent actions, such as creating workplace hazards (e.g. gas leaks), tampering with equipment, excessive force, and confinement in unsafe conditions are examples of Manslaughter. |
| 304  | [Weapon](Possession_of_restricted_weapons_2.png)             | **Possession of a Restricted Weapon** | To be in possession of a restricted weapon without prior authorisation, such as: Guns, Batons, Flashes, Grenades, etc. | Any item that can cause severe bodily harm or incapacitate for a significant time. The following personnel have unrestricted license to carry weapons and firearms: Captain, HoP, all Security Personnel.The Barman is permitted his double barrel shotgun loaded with beanbag rounds. Only the Captain and HoS can issue weapon permits. |

For second offences or outright instigating violent uprisings consider charging with Mutiny. |
| 307  | [File:Disrupting power.png](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Disrupting_power.png) | **Sabotage**                          | To hinder the work of the crew or station through malicious actions. | Deliberately releasing N2O, bolting doors, disabling the power network, and constructing barricades are but some of many means of sabotage.

This includes any Security Area, Command area (including EVA), the Engine Room, Atmos, or Toxins Research. | Being in a very high security area, such as the armoury or the Captain's Quarters, is a more serious crime, and warrants a time of 10 minutes with a possible permabrigging if intent is believed to be malicious. |
| 310  | [File:BE Restricted.PNG](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=BE_Restricted.PNG) | **B&E of a Restricted Area**          | This is breaking into any Security area, Command area (Bridge, EVA, Captains Quarters, Teleporter, etc.), the Engine Room, Atmos, or Toxins research. | As a major crime sentences start at 5 minutes, but can be extended if security believes break in was for attempted Grand Theft or attempted Grand Sabotage (yellow gloves don't count as grand theft). |
| 311  | [Dereliction](Derliction_of_duty)                            | **Dereliction of Duty**               | To willfully abandon an obligation that is critical to the station's continued operation. | A demotion is often included in the sentence. Emphasis on the word critical: An officer taking a break is not dereliction in of itself. An officer taking a break knowing that operatives are shooting up the Captain is. Engineers who do not secure a power source at the start of the shift and heads of staff who abandon the station can also be charged. |



### Capital Crimes

These crimes can result in Execution, Permanent Prison Time, Permanent Labor Camp Time, or Cyborgization.

Only the Captain, HoS, and Warden can authorize a Permanent Sentence.

Only the Captain can authorize an Execution or Forced Cyborgization.

| Code |                                                              | Crime                        | Description                                                  | Notes                                                        |

Murder committed by temporary emotional distress, such as fear or anger, warrants lower punishments. Cyborg candidates must have brains fit to obey relevant laws. Life imprisonment is the most humane option for the insane who might malfunction as cyborgs. **Unauthorised executions are classed as Murder.** |
| 402  | [File:Sexual Assault.PNG](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Sexual_Assault.PNG) | **Sexual Assault**           | To molest or otherwise sexually attack someone.              | Unconsented ERP scenes, regardless of OOC consent by all parties, is a violation of server rules, and worthy of a **permanent ban**. Adminhelp it if this happens to you; it's against server rules, not just station rules. |
| 403  | [File:Attempted Murder.PNG](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Attempted_Murder.PNG) | **Attempted Murder**         | To use physical force against a person until that person is in a critical state with the apparent intent to kill them. | Remember, if a person attempts to render first aid after the victim falls into a critical state they may not have intend to kill them. |
| 404  | x | **Canibalism** | respect no found , eat meat human, or other crewmembers, you know that just a crims to humanity (and other)| x |

| 406  | [File:Mutiny.PNG](https://unitystation.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Mutiny.PNG) | **Mutiny**                   | To act individually, or as a group, to overthrow or subvert the established Chain of Command without lawful and legitimate cause. | Mutiny is not as clear cut as it may seem, there may be a legitimate reason for their actions, such as their head of staff being utterly incompetent. This is one of the few crimes where it is recommended to always seek a third party opinion. If their actions are determined to be for the betterment of Nanotrasen consider a timed sentence or even a full pardon. |
| 407  | [Compromising Station Integrity](Grand_Sabotage.pnh)         | **Grand Sabotage**           | To engage in maliciously destructive actions, seriously threatening crew or station. | Bombing, arson, releasing viruses, deliberately exposing areas to space, physically destroying machinery or electrifying doors all count as Grand Sabotage. |
| 408  | [High value target theft](Grand Theft.png)                   | **Grand Theft**              | To steal items of high value or sensitive nature.            | Syndicate agents frequently attempt to steal cutting-edge technology. Examples include: intelligence or research samples, the Hand Teleporter, the Captain's Antique Laser, the Captain or the HoP's ID cards, or Mechs.
