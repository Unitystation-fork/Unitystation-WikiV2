# Access
Note: This guide is about access and getting it, for the job that changes it, look for the HoP guide [here](HoP.md).

## So you want to open a door?

Well, surprisingly, getting into an area is something that may appear easy, but is underneath very complex. In this guide there will be a variety of ways to get into rooms, both legal and illegal.

### The completely legal ways

If your the goody two shoes sort, there are several ways to get into places without worrying about your moral compass.

- Just use your own ID to open doors you have access to. The most boring and plain way, but the most efficient and legal by far.
- Get your ID changed legally by the [HoP](HoP.md) or [Captain](Captain.md) to get access, then try option 1 above. This will likely involve talking, but unless your trying to get into an area thought of as secure, it generally fairly easy.
- Convince someone to let you in. If your persuasive enough, have made a bud, or are lacking time, this is a good way to legally get into areas. If its a secure area this will likely not work, but you can probably ask them for the specific thing your after regardless. If you just want the item but they aren't willing to give it up, propose a trade. if you offer the [CMO](Chief-medical-officer.md) an smg for some medicine, he's more than likely to give it to you in a fair exchange.


### The Grey Area

Some ways of getting into an area are in a gray area, and can be legal or illegal depending on who you ask and where it is done..

- Follow somebody inside. Wait outside the door, then, when someone passes in, tail them inside the room. This is often ignored for places like the kitchen or medical, but can get your ass kicked if you do it to enter someplace like command or security.
- Convince somebody, but lie. If your found out, security may do something about it, but unless you did it to get into a secure area its unlikely anyone will care.
- Bribe someone to let you enter. If you give someone a nice wad of cash or a gun, they'll be much more likely to "accidentally" leave the door open for you. This will work on practically everyone short of the most dutiful, command, and security. If your feeling ballsy, you can try to bribe the [HoP](HoP.md) himself into giving you access.


### The Illegal Ways

The most varied of the categories is the ways you can get in without permission.

- Threaten your way in. This is unlikely to work and anyone you threaten is more likely to call security than let you inside.

-  Fit in to get in. Use a disguise and you can probably convince someone to let you inside, so long as they dont look at your ID.

- "I'm in". Use "[hacking](Hacking-Guide.md)" and rearrange wires until the door opens for you regardless of ID. Make sure to learn the wires beforehand so you don't stand there for minutes looking suspicious as hell.

-  Get the ID of someone who has access. Mug, Slip, or kill a proper someone, take their ID, and use it to open the door. This has a high success rate, but will also make you get caught equally often.

-  Clean burglarizing. Disassemble (don't break) a window or wall cleanly to make your way inside. makes little noise but requires knowledge of [construction](Construction.md) and a good chunk of time.

- a dirty break-in. Destroy a window using a weapon of some sort, or, if your VERY well armed, destroy the door or wall. Windows are much more weak to gunshots than melee weapons, so much so that if your trying to use a melee weapon your usually better off just stealing a gun and coming back.

- Explosions (or fire). If you can get an explosive, you can try blowing apart the wall or window. you can also try to use a plasmafire to do the same. This is greatly frowned upon if you aren't an [antagonist](Antagonist.md), but is by far the most stylish way of doing it.
