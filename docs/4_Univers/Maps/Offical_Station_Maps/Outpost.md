# Outpost
Outpost Station is the oldest, and most changed station in the game, authored by Epicworlds (aka Avalanche) on August 7th, 2017 for testing purposes. Originally being quite a small map, it has grown significantly, now being one of the largest maps in the current map pool. Intending to offer a vanilla experience, Outpost has grid-like disposition with several core departments having multiple access points.

Medical and Security are centralized, standing across from each other, with service rooms dotted around them. Engineering and the Chapel make up the east half of the station while Cargo, the Dormitories, and science make up the west. Evac is placed at the south and the bridge and AI satellite cover the entire north section of the station.

It is currently a high-population map, requiring 20 players in game to be randomly drawable.
