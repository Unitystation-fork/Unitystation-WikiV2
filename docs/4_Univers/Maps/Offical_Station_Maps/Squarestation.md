# Squarestation



Squarestation is a low-population map authored by ThatDaniel on July 13th, 2020. 

Squarestation is built around the use of quantum pads to navigate throughout the station, with each department being separated into it's own disconnected module. Originally having no maintenance at all, it was heavily expanded and given a significant amount of maintenance a few months after it's release.
