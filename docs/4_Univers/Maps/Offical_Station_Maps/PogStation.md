Pog Station is the Second map to be added to the game, authored by 0ozymandias on February 19th, 2020. Themed around being a revamped casino station, the map has circular motif, with a single narrow maintenance tunnel covering half the station's exterior.

It is currently a high-population map, requiring 20 players in game to be randomly drawable.
