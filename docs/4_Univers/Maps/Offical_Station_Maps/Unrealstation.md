# UnrealStation

UnrealStation is a low-population map authored by spbrian (Akbadain29) on January 24th, 2021. The map is a large irregular circle with a wide and extensive ring of maintenance circumventing the entire working space. 

Security and the Dorms are placed in the center of the map with the rest of the departments lining the inside of the circle. Arrivals and the away portal are separated into a satellite visiting center that accesses the main station via a quantum pad. The map has a large emphasis on travelling by disposal chutes, with several department rooms being connected by disposal networks.

The map is currently not supported and isn't in the map pool.
