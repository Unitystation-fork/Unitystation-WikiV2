# Boxstation

Boxstation (also known as tgstation, dating back to *2011*) is a map ported from ss13 by ThatDaniel, though an incomplete earlier port did exist for a time before. It was added to the map pool in February 20th 2020. Boxstation is the largest map currently in the map pool, with extensive maintenance covering the south, southwest, and north east sections of the map. 

When it comes to the gameplay experience, Boxstation is somewhat of a lopsided map, as most of the action tends to occur on the east side of the station where command, science, medical, the dorms, and most of the service rooms are.

It is currently a high-population map, requiring 20 players in game to be randomly drawable.
