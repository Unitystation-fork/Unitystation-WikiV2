# Ministation

Ministation (loosely based on the /tg/station map of the same name) is the newest map currently in the map pool. It is a low-population map authored by AtnerNT on January 19th, 2022. A small/medium-sized map, Ministation goes for a balanced approach, with no particular department having a disproportionate footprint.
