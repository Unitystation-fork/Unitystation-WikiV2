# Ancient Temple
The Ancient Temple is one of the four possible teleporter destinations and it takes the form of a deep crypt buried deep underground inhabited by a large number of hostile entities. The teleporter is located at the southwest corner of the map. To the east is a small abandoned outpost with a kitchen, a mostly depleted armoury, basic power facility, and mining equipment. To the north is a sprawling maze of dark passages and chambers, eventually leading to a large temple room. 

Lurking within both the outpost and the maze are [[Skeleton (Mob)|animated skeletons]] (as well as a few [[Husk (Mob)|husks]]). In the temple room, as well as in a few offshooting hallways, are a couple dozen stone statues. Some of these statues are actually [[Stone Statue (Mob)|animated]], and will ambush characters when they come close. The animated statues hit particularly hard, so it's a good idea to test each statue if it is alive or not before coming close if you have spare ammo.

There is a very high amount of gold and silver in both ore and bar form in the maze and temple room, as well as many stacks of sand, so bring a mining satchel and some extra crewmen to carry all the loot. Of particular note, offshooting to the west of the temple room is the golden room, which has a dense concentration of minerals.
