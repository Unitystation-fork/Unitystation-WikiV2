# Weapons
There are many different weapons availble in Unitystation. There are ballistic weapons that use bullets and have magazines and laser weapons that charge up and use batteries.
 Lasers are cool, have a very intimidating visual effect, can bounce off certain surfaces and pass through glass. BUT are dependent on a power outlet and usually only have 10 shots. (to get more you need a high capacity battery) has two modes, disable (which drops the gun to the ground) and kill (which causes burn damage)
 Ballistic weapons, which require ammunition, usually contained in a magazine or clip. A trigger pull causes a detonation, ejects a hot case and projects a warhead (bullet) in the chosen direction and make bruse dommage 8 for the 9mm chageur 20 for the WT550 (4.6x30mm) 30 for the M90 (5.56mm) 
   **For the rest**, I will introduce you to some of the weapons available to the HoS and the Warden. Some however, are reserved for centcom officers and the Syndicate.

## Training weapons
Replica weapons are mainly used for training and handling. Also includes foam dart launchers. beware, it is often difficult to tell at first glance a replica from a real weapon. consider them as potentially dangerous (when in doubt).
 - The lasertag and training rifle contain 12 shots each.
 -  the dart throwers, 8 for the point replicas, 20 for the mags, and 4 for the shotguns.
As their name indicates, they do not cause damage, only a quick irritation of the security and the janitor.

## Non-lethal weapons

Which includes, telescopic baton, baton (tonfa) electric baton, taser V43 and V42, handcuffs, zipties And incapacitating gas spray.
 - Tasers have two modes.
	 -  "Stun" which sends electrodes towards a target at SHORT range, if they hit, it causes a strong electric shock that puts him down for a few moments (~15s).
	- "Disable" which sends out a high-velocity incapacitating laser beam. It can pass through glass and bounce off certain surfaces. If the target is hit, it will fall to the ground for a few seconds (useful for chases) They must be recharged on a charging station. 10 Stun mode shooting 20 in desable mode
 -  Telescopic baton, (usually held by department heads and superior officers) Forces the target to the ground.
  - Baton (tonfa) usually held by the warden, allows the law to be applied with force and discernment. Generally used on uncooperative prisoners, or cadets officiers, who are too talkative.
 - Electric baton. If you hit a target with it, the target will writhe in pain, incapacitate, and collapse to the ground for 45-50s, giving you time to handcuff the person.
  - Handcuffs and zip ties, to restrict a suspect's freedom of movement. beware, if left unattended for 60s, he may try to break out the handcuffs (30s for zip ties)

## Laser Weapons  
Which exists in several versions, The simple model with 12 grey shots. the advanced black and red model with 10 shots (or 20 in desable) the high capacity model, generally held by the centcom
- Special version: Justicia (HOS)20 load or 40 disable Imp√©rator (Capt) 12 load ------ 

## Ballistic projectile weapons

Weapons with a magazine have the advantage, once the magazine is empty and removed from the weapon, of being able to be thrown at the target, saving you time when reloading. 

- Point weapons (or handguns)
	- OP70 With a magazine containing 8 rounds of ammunition and available in special effect magazines (such as incendiary ammunition, phasing...)
	 - p238 (or 38 special) (usually held by the detective) contains 6 rounds of .38 special ammunition.
	  - p375 (or lucifer) which contains 7 rounds of 375 magnun ammunition
	   - Punisher contains 7 rounds of ammunition in a .44 calibre magazine
	    - Colt 1901 Magazine of 8 rounds load at .45 ammo is only used for official ceremonies or by certain collectors. ----- 

- Automatic Handguns

	- Unlike the handgun, these weapons have a word "bullet". It is highly recommended not to use the "full-auto" mode but rather to make bursts of 3 shots. Less chance of wasted ammo, crossfire or stray bullets. More chance of hitting your target.
	 - R550C pwc load in 4.6x30mm 20 round magazine magazin exists with special effects
	  - Nanostrasen Saber SMG 21 rounds in magazin , 9mm magazin exists with special effects - Stechkin machine pistol weapon held by the centcom a 15 round magazine in 9mm parabelum. exists with various special effects, (piercing, incendiary, hollowpoint, ... )
	   - Uzi Load in 9mm 21 round magazine accepts special magazines - M1928 thomson SMG 50 - .45 --- 

## Shoulder Weapons
-  All of the following weapons share a common ammunition, namely the .12 gauge shotgun shell. which is a multipurpose ammunition, allowing for effects such as non-lethal ammunition (beans, tasers) or incendiary, ion, laser, disuptor, frag, etc.
- It has a correct range with a reduced cone of diffusion. The only drawback is that modularity comes at a price; reloading speed.
- Shotguns
	 - Riot Shotgun, 4 shell loaded
	 - S24 Combat shotgun, 8 shell loaded, has a semi-automatic reload.
	  - S24c combat shotgun, 4shell loaded, The compact version, usually held by the warden, has a semi-automatic reload.
	   - S3 Hunter shotgun (doublebarrel) a good double-barrelled side-by-side shotgun. usually held by the bartender and loaded with bean or rubber ball
	    - Shotgun , a simple pump-action shotgun with semi-automatic reloading.
- Carbine
	- M90gl compact and pulpup weapon, ambidextrous loaded in 5.56mm accepts 30 rounds per magazine available in special effect magazines and some antique bolt action weapons. generally kept for collection and historical value.
- **"its place is in a museum"**
	 - M1928 thomson SMG and its drum magazine of 50 rounds in .45 
	- Mosin-nagant M1891 (which is a bolt action rifle) and 7.62 (and other old bolt action carabine/rifles)
		-  Their ammunition is often unreliable, unobtainable and there are almost none left with original parts, time having done its work, notably organic material such as wood.
 - Grenade launcher, kept under lock and key by the warden, uses 40mm effect ammunition (smoke, explosive, incendiary etc) to be used only as a last resort.
	 - There are also hand grenades with a safety pin.
		 -  exists in the form of an EMP (electromagnetic pulse)
		 -  Incendiary grenade Fumigene Incapacitating (flash)
		 -  or chemical (used to disperse gas, such as pepper, care, or lethal gas, read the label carefully)
- You will sometimes find improvised weapons, such as shards of glass, spears made from knives or stolen batteries. Don't underestimate these, they can hurt you as surely as a combat knife. (edited)

## Experimental or Unknown Weapons
- the centcom presents sometimes on public demonstration some of its unique and extraordinary weapons.
	 - Disuptor which exists in handgun, automatic, and carabine (shoulder weapons) formats including various capacities (from 10 to 200 shots) has a stun, kill, and destroy mode (which disintegrates solid structures, such as walls and doors) There is also a miniaturized version in .12 calibre for standard shotguns.
-  We have few information about these weapons. only the names
	 - Thermal carbine
	  - Tactical energy carbine (stun, disable, kill modes)
	   - Tesla carbine - X-ray carbine (shoots through walls)
	    - Ion carbine / shell - Cycler Shotgun 
- **Space legend** ( unreliable sources)
	-  Some legends speak of unreferenced weapons, such as the "Makarof" pistol which would be a discreet handgun, using 9mm magazines.
	-  a "Stalker" SMG with a 24 round magazine, loaded with .45acp
	-  a "Bulldozer" which would be a pump-action shotgun with a drum magazine a "Migraine" with 6 round magazin loaded with .50 In view of the unseriousness of the sources and names, this is probably a bad galactic joke.
