# Welcome to Unitystation Documentation ! #
## What is Unitystation? ##

**Unitystation** is an online multiplayer 2D RPG game running on the Unity engine.

It is a free, open-source, role-playing game.

Unitystation is a fun video tool that provides players with all the tools to immerse themselves in space life and practice **Role Play**


You play as a character, a crew member of the military-industrial space station of Nanotrasen.

Depending on your job, you have various objectives.

## SS13 ? byond ?Unity? ##


## What is the goal? ##

To work with the crew to operate the space station and to achieve the business objectives sent to you by the company that employs you, Nanotrasen.



For example:

The cook must keep everyone well fed. :cut_of_meat:

The botanist must grow vegetables for the cook and the doctor. :seedling:

The doctor tries to keep his patients alive. :medical_symbol:

The scientist is trying to unlock the secrets of the universe. :microscope:

The caretaker keeps the floor clean and alive. :broom:

The guards try to stay alive and keep the station safe :police_officer:



You may encounter unforeseen circumstances, whether it be a meteor shower, an epidemic, aliens invading the station, or an undercover agent ordered to kill you in a maintenance corridor.



It's up to you to do your best to do your job and survive.





## Can we win? ##

(Technically, )it's a roleplay game, in the sense that the collective experience is an end in itself.

The game is richer in the interaction with other players, in your individual or collective goals.



Although you can die, be cloned or come back to life as another character, the player has a freedom of creation and expression, within the framework of his job or in a more secret way.



## Can you die? ##

Yes, and there is no shortage of causes:

Shot, stabbed, asphyxiated in the vacuum of space, devoured by a creature, swallowed in a black hole, of an unknown disease coming out of the laboratory, dismembered, electrocuted and many other possibilities...

There's plenty to choose from!



## And then what? ##

You can interact with many objects, create or destroy them.

Play, experiment, discuss, learn, mine, crack, heal, eat, run, die,

start over (differently or not).

(Players can destroy, build and modify everything.

Every electrical cable, every pipe can be important.

From incredible engineering projects, to the sheer chaos of destruction, let your imagination run wild.

Share your stories, anecdotes, fan art.





## **On board there are a few rules:** ##

Don't be a Asshole

No Metagaming/powergaming
