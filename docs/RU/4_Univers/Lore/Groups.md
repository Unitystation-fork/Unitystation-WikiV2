A Megacorporation, the largest in the galaxy, that controls the station that UnityStation takes place on. Research is what kept Nanotrasen a step ahead of all other corporations, with new technological marvels like Blue Space Teleportation, Advanced Medical Machines, Genetic Manipulation, and Cloning. 

However, in the decades leading up to the present, the company was losing money and influence due to rival corporations and foreign empires. That trend forecasted the doom of NanoTrasen as a dominant power in known space, at least, until NT's expeditionary branch discovered a system filled with a new, rare, and mysterious material: Plasma, the discovery of which has secured NanoTrasen a new, financially liquid future for NanoTrasen so long as they maintain their monopoly over the mysterious product.

The Syndicate isn't so much one corporation, as it is a union of multiple companies, mercenary organizations, and raider groups. A loose coalition at best, each member group of the Syndicate works with the rest only as necessary to undermine their common enemy: NanoTrasen. As a well-funded, conspiratorial, and militant group, NanoTrasen regards the Syndicate as their number one enemy, and with good reason; The Syndicate have many times been responsible for the [destruction](Traitor.md) [of](Nuclear-Emergency.md) NanoTrasen's advanced research space stations.
