# RP words and abbreviations
This page is a list of words and abbreviations usually used in games of unitystation, as well as a short description to help new people find out what they mean

Abbreviation for Out Of Character. Used for discussions outside of the game (for example letting people know how ridiculous your death was). OOC chat's default key is U.

<big>'IC'</big>

Abbreviation for In Character. Used for communicating in-roleplay with other people. IC chat's default key is T (Y for IC chat over communications, if you have a comms headset equipped).

<big>'Metagaming**</big> **[against the rules]'

The IC use of information that you gained OOCly, an example being to kill John Doe because someone OOCly is complaining to an admin about how John RDMed. Another, less frequently used form of metagaming is Metagrudging, in which you attack or otherwise interact with someone based on something that happened in a previous round of Unitystation.

<big>'Icky Ocky**</big> **[against the rules]'
